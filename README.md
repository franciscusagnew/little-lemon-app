This is my [Meta Frontend Capstone]() web project for the Little Lemon Reastaurant, bootstrapped with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:(provided port)](http://localhost:(provided port)) with your browser to see the result.

## Running Test

The project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for unit testing in the tests directory located at 'src/app/tests/'. There you will find several test that you can run by doing the following:

Open a terminal in the app's root directory and run:

npm run start

In another terminal run:

npx playwright test
